CHANGELOG

* Sprites
	+ Can use sprite sheets (Only sprites, doesn't work for tilemaps)
	+ Class name can different from sprite type name/id
	+ Sprite moving
		* Left click + drag moves it
		* Right clicking allows you to add a string value to it
	+ Checks to avoid repeated name/ids (that would mess with importing/exporting/merging sprite types.)
	+ Merging of sprite type lists! (to copy types around maps. Not the most elegant solution but works)

	+ Placement: Centered, Sides, Corners
		* If grid-aligned it means "aligned to that tile's place"
			~now preview in final position and visible grid selector (before previewd on cursor then placed on final pos)
		* If not it means "respective to the cursor"

* Export
	+ Unique file per map with a big-ass object (with all CSVs inside as Strings, all image references, etc)
		* You'll need to set the export/output directory again if loading a previous map
	+ New "more generic" export format
	+ /template directory for customizable export (see replacement-variables reference at bottom of this doc)
	+ A lot more info for sprites (can export image info, etc).
	+ Don't export" feature for Sprite Types and Layers
		Useful for using layout images in the editor or mocking up placement before the class exists

* Layers
	+ Lock-Sprites option to avoid add/remove/move/edit of sprites on that layer.

* Bugfixes
	~ Importing of sprite types sometimes breaking up (rewrite)
	~ Fixed bug that crashed the app when undoing the bucket tool

* Can load previous versions map files (I think), but CSV/AS3 directories are no longer used. You'll need to specify
a new export dir.
