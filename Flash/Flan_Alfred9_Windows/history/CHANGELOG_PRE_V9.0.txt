-- Maps are always compatible with newer application versions --

SUGGESTION FOR PROTOTYPING:
For prototyping, use one layer AND one tileset for non-collidable tiles and another pair for collidable tiles.
This way you won't have to replace a lot of tiles when adding more non-collidable tiles.
The non-collidables first collidable index could be set really high to forget about it.


ALPHA 8.5
* Right-click deletes the topmost sprite first on right-click
* Preview of where the sprite will be when placed
* 

ALPHA 8.4
* Sprite export to clipboard

ALPHA 8

IMPORTANT: READ THE FOLLOWING FIX

* FIX: Solved error when saving non-animated images introduced in alpha 7.
	Symptom: You can't open the map: "stream error"
	Solution: You must open the .flan with a text editor (it's XML), and change all
		numbers '4294967295' to '-1' (without inv. commas).
		And use "Alpha 8" or higher where I solved it.


* FIX: Pressing "Modify" on a non-animated sprite would unload it. Now it's ok.
* Generated code now generates "onAddSpriteCallback" instead of "on<MAP NAME>AddSpriteCallback"
* Moved the "single sprite" checkbox in the Sprite Type dialog up to make it more intuitive to be pressed before
	choosing a tileset
* corrected Sprite Type window size (now you can see the OK/Cancel buttons)
^ now "bgColor" is saved in the map (see MapBase.as), in case you want to use different colors for diff levels.

ALPHA 7.2
* Fix in grids (map custom values/per-sprite properties):
	They weren't saving any info on some special (most) conditions.

ALPHA 7
! IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE WITH ALPHA 6:
	Custom map values are now not strings, could be anything (even functions).
	Don't worry about incompatibility: it's fixed when imported, but take into account
	next time you write a value in a grid (this also applies to sprite custom values).

+ Flood-fill bucket tool [UNDOABLE]
+ Status bar with pixel/tile position information.
+ Custom per-sprite parameters (property-value grid)

^ Palette shows "No layer selected" instead of a blank frame on new maps.

* Fixed undo/redo: Now disabled if nothing to undo/redo (I think it crashed before the fix, never noticed it)
* Undo/redo text: Tells you what are you undoing or redoing
* Palette shows the correct tileset as soon as you change between layers.
* Currently selected layer set bold in the layer list to make it more obvious


ALPHA 6
+ New tab: Custom stuff.
+	Allows you to add some custom string-string name-value pairs to the map.
+	And a custom function that takes a "*" parameter and returns a "*" value, to call whenever you want.
+ Tools menu with the option to easily associate .flan files with the application.
* Abilityto add non-square 1-frame sprites.
* Started to port it to be plugin-friendly (for import, export AND on-the-fly modification filters)

ALPHA 5
+ Export/Import de sprite type lists, in case you changed a map and want to carry that list to other similar ones
	(Experimental, save your work before trying!)
+ Full layer tile replacement (all of indexA to indexB).
	It's awful and tedious but, for now, it's quite functional (specially for the "expansion" of tilesets)
+ Added map name to the title of the application for knowing what you're working on.
+ You can now set the "Package" for the exported ".as" files, to match the path you want.
* Corrected generation of code for addition of sprites (_map.addSprites...)
* Sprite tool: If not aligned to grid, there is no tile selection square when adding sprites (that usually bothers)
* Warning message if you want to remove a layer (before it just dissapeared). I think it would be nice as this is not undoable.
* If not grid aligned, sprites are put centered to the cursor (instead of top-left aligned as before)
* Fixed weird-rect-for-text-labels bug (reverted to old revision of wxWidgets)
* Fixed: deletion of sprite type didn't remove sprites of that type.
* Fixed: Incorrect display of Parallax test rect if map was scrolled.

ALPHA 4
+ SPRITES! YEAAAAH! (Basic thou, read below)
+ Layer width/height suggestions for parallaxing depending on scroll factors and main layer's width/height.
+ "Visibility" tab's options implementedd (now called "Layer visibility" tab)
+ Undo/Redo for painting PER TILE and nothing else (rather basic, see below)
+ You can pass a .flan as a parameter to open it. Also, the exe has an embedded icon for files, if you want to use it.
  You can now do the "open always with" thing in Windows (Future: automatically do it with a menu option)
* You can now type the "-" sign in spin controls (wxWidgets bugfix)
* Generated map max bounds were off by 1 pixel
^ Improvements in parallax testing code
^ Screen box when testing parallaxing to have a better idea of what "you will see"

v BUG: wxWidgets new trunk version makes the Editing layer text flicker on redraw.
	If it doesn't get mouse moves, resize the window a bit.
v BUG: Weird drawing when hovering with mouse while testing parallaxing.

Sprites:
	The type must be selected from the Sprites Tab for now. (Future: From palette)
	Only addition and removal of sprites is enabled. Left/Right click respectively with sprite tool. (Future: Selectable/moveable)

	Micro how-to:
	Add Sprite type in the Sprites tab. Select it in the list.
	In the palette window, select the little guy button (Sprite tool)

	You can set "Align to grid when adding" in the sprite tab to center sprites to the grid.
	NOTE: if you change offset.x/y in your sprite's Constructor, it's used to correct the position when loading.
	NOTE2: you must call _map.addSpritesForLayer<LayerName>() when you want to add them.
		You can pass a function that receives a FlxSprite as parameter, which is called each time a sprite is added.
		You can do something like "if(objAdded is Coin)  { _coins.add(objAdded); }" and such there.
	"Generate code to clipboard" to see what I'm talking about.

Undo/Redo:
	100 levels deep, feedback if it's not enough.
	WARNING: Removing layers CLEARS the undo list (for anti-crash reasons)


ALPHA 3
* Highly improved rendering speed/less CPU eating
* Hopefully fixed all scrolling and pixel offsets issues :)
+ Import and export single layer CSVs. You can load your previous work to Flan!
+ New properties tab: Screen
+ Parallax testing
+ Background color in generated code using a non-scrolling color-sprite (Thanks Adam for the idea!)
+ Layer limits outlined
* Fixed incorrect name shown at "Editing layer" in the main window.
* Can't draw on hidden layers

ALPHA 2
+ Per layer parallaxing (offset + scroll factor)
+ Bounds information: How much pixels does the map use? (useful for FlxG.followBounds(), exported to AS3 and on the editor)
+ Optional generation of a base map class for OOP multiple map loading
+ Better help on Properties window tabs.
+ Moving one/all layer tiles by a given offset
* Fixed error in scrolling


ALPHA 1
+ Paint with left click and use pipette with right click.
+ Multiple layer editing
+ Save/load all layer info to a single .flan file (except for tileset images).
+ Set directories and easily export to CSV and AS3 code.
+ Generate code to add generated layers to a FlxState on clipboard.
+ Resize/Cropping of each layer individually
+ Hide/show layers while editing for comodity and performance
